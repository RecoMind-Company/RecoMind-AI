        "3. **FOLLOW THE PLAN:** You MUST follow the `key_info` object **EXACTLY** for all join conditions.\n"
        "4. **IGNORE USER REQUEST:** The original '{user_request}' text is IRRELEVANT to you. You ONLY obey the structured `selected_columns` and `key_info`.\n"

        "   - **Part B (Generic Names):** If `selected_columns` has *generic names* (like `Name`, `Title`, `FirstName`), you **MUST** give them descriptive aliases based on their table (e.g., `prod.Name AS ProductName`, `person.FirstName AS CustomerFirstName`).\n"

        "6. **CRITICAL RULE (ESCAPE KEYWORDS):** You MUST put square brackets `[]` around any SQL reserved keyword used as a column or table name (e.g., `Sales.SalesTerritory.[Group]`, `Sales.[Order]`).\n\n"

        "**CRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (MOST IMPORTANT):**\n"
