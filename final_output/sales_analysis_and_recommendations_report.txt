### **Part 1: Sales Analysis Report**  

#### **1. Introduction**  
The company generated **$2.44B in total revenue** with an **Average Order Value (AOV) of $20,126.74**, indicating high-value transactions. However, a **-0.62% year-over-year revenue decline** signals concerning trends. The **repeat order rate of 39.07%** suggests moderate customer loyalty, while **top territories (Southwest, Canada, Northwest)** dominate revenue. Key opportunities lie in optimizing product mix, improving underperforming regions, and addressing revenue volatility.

#### **2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Analysis**  
- **Total Revenue ($2.44B)**: Reflects overall sales health but masks a decline. High revenue is driven by top territories (Southwest: $544.8M) and products (782: $1.92M).  
- **Average Order Value (AOV) ($20,126.74)**: Indicates premium positioning. Low-volume, high-margin products (e.g., 782, 783) dominate revenue, while high-volume products (e.g., 712, 870) contribute less per unit.  
- **Total Quantity Sold (274,914)**: Highlights a broad customer base but aligns with low AOV for mass-market products (e.g., 712, 870).  
- **Top Products by Revenue (782, 783, 784, 779, 781)**: High-value items drive profitability. Contrast with top volume products (712, 870) suggests a gap in upselling opportunities.  
- **Top Territories (Southwest, Canada, Northwest)**: Generate **$1.35B combined (55% of revenue)**. Underperforming regions (Central, Northeast) lag significantly.  
- **Year-over-Year Growth (-0.62%)**: Decline driven by 2014 revenue drop ($414.9M vs. 2013’s $1.09B), likely due to seasonality or market shifts.  
- **Repeat Order Rate (39.07%)**: Room for improvement; 61% of orders are one-time transactions.  
- **Top Countries (US: $1.53B, CA: $456.6M, GB: $161.5M)**: US dominance underscores domestic strength.

#### **3. Key Insights**  
- **Revenue Volatility**: 2014 revenue ($414.9M) is 62% lower than 2013 ($1.09B), with June 2014 orders plummeting to 939 (vs. 2,411 in May). This signals instability requiring urgent intervention.  
- **Product Strategy Disconnect**: Top revenue products (e.g., 782) are low-volume/high-margin, while top volume products (e.g., 712) are low-margin. Bundling or cross-selling could bridge this gap.  
- **Regional Imbalance**: Southwest and Canada drive 41% of revenue, while Central and Northeast contribute only 18%. Underperforming regions need tailored strategies.  
- **Customer Retention**: Only 39% of customers reorder, indicating missed opportunities for loyalty programs and personalized engagement.  
- **Operational Efficiency**: Average shipping time (7 days) is consistent, but freight costs (2.48%) could erode margins if not optimized.

#### **4. Conclusion**  
Despite strong total revenue, the company faces critical challenges: revenue decline, regional imbalance, and untapped potential in upselling and retention. Focus on high-margin products, underperforming regions, and customer loyalty is essential to reverse the decline and sustain growth.

### **Part 2: Actionable Recommendations**  

#### **1. Short-Term Plan (0-3 Months)**  
**Goal: Increase total orders by 15% (from current ~1,488/month to 1,711/month).**  

**Analysis:**  
- **Current monthly orders**: Average of April-June 2014 = 1,488 (June anomaly: 939 orders).  
- **Best regions**: Southwest, Canada.  
- **Underperforming regions**: Central, Northeast.  
- **Key trends**: Seasonal peaks in Q4, low repeat orders, and 2014 revenue volatility.  

**Recommendations/Actions:**  
- **Digital Marketing Campaigns**:  
  - **Budget**: 15% of marketing budget.  
  - **Target**: Underperforming regions (Central, Northeast) and high-value segments.  
  - **Expected impact**: 10% order increase from targeted regions.  
  - *Reasoning*: Leverage data to address regional gaps with hyper-localized ads.  
- **Incentive Programs**:  
  - **Bonus**: $50 per extra order (baseline: current monthly average).  
  - **Criteria**: Prioritize orders from underperforming regions or high-AOV products.  
  - *Reasoning*: Directly incentivizes sales teams to close gaps.  
- **Training Programs**:  
  - **Tailored training**: Reps in Central/Northeast focus on high-margin products; Southwest/Canada reps focus on cross-selling.  
  - *Reasoning*: Aligns skills with regional needs.  

**Scenarios:**  
- **Best Case**: 20% order increase → 1,786 orders/month → $360M annual revenue.  
- **Moderate Case**: 15% increase → 1,711 orders/month → $345M annual revenue.  
- **Worst Case**: 5% increase → 1,563 orders/month → $315M annual revenue.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Reallocate 50% of digital marketing budget to incentive programs if orders grow <10%. Focus retention campaigns if underperformance persists.

#### **2. Mid-Term Plan (3-6 Months)**  
**Goal: Increase AOV by 10% (to $22,139) and improve margins by 5%.**  

**Analysis:**  
- **Current AOV**: $20,126.74.  
- **Top products**: High-margin revenue drivers (782, 783, 784).  
- **Low-margin high-volume products**: 712, 870, 711.  

**Recommendations/Actions:**  
- **Cross-selling/Bundling**:  
  - Bundle top revenue products (e.g., 782 + 712) at a 5% discount.  
  - *Reasoning*: Increases AOV while moving high-volume inventory.  
- **Pricing Adjustments**:  
  - Increase prices of top-margin products (782, 783) by 5–7%.  
  - *Reasoning*: Margins (Freight: 2.48%, Tax: 7.94%) allow room without alienating customers.  

**Scenarios:**  
- **Best Case**: 15% AOV increase + 7% margin boost → $423M/month revenue.  
- **Moderate Case**: 10% AOV increase + 5% margin boost → $382M/month revenue.  
- **Worst Case**: 5% AOV increase + 2% margin boost → $361M/month revenue.  

**Risk Management:**  
- If bundle adoption <30%, reduce discounts to 3%. If price hikes reduce orders, revert to original pricing and focus on cost-cutting.

#### **3. Long-Term Plan (6+ Months)**  
**Goal: Increase annual sales growth by 20% and expand market share.**  

**Analysis:**  
- **Current growth**: -0.62% YoY.  
- **Untapped regions**: Germany, France, Australia (low revenue vs. potential).  
- **Top channels**: Direct sales (primary); need digital/social expansion.  

**Recommendations/Actions:**  
- **Geographic Expansion**:  
  - **Investment**: $10M in Germany/France (low-revenue, high-potential).  
  - **Strategy**: Local partnerships and bilingual support.  
- **Channel Development**:  
  - **Budget**: $5M for e-commerce and social platforms.  
  - **Strategy**: Target SMBs via LinkedIn/Twitter.  
- **Social Selling**:  
  - **Training**: 50% of reps to engage on LinkedIn (focus on high-value industries).  
  - *Reasoning*: Captures B2B opportunities missed by traditional sales.  

**Scenarios:**  
- **Best Case**: 30% growth → $3.17B annual revenue.  
- **Moderate Case**: 20% growth → $2.93B annual revenue.  
- **Worst Case**: 5% growth → $2.56B annual revenue.  

**Risk Management:**  
- If new regions underperform by >15%, reduce investment by 50% and redirect to digital channels. If social ROI <2x, pivot to email marketing.

**Final Note:** Prioritize short-term stabilization (addressing 2014 revenue drops) while executing mid/long-term strategies. Continuous monitoring of regional performance and product margins is critical.
